# DataMorphix

## Introduction

DataMorphix is a powerful data transformation and optimization tool designed to streamline the way you work with data. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or developer, DataMorphix provides a wide range of features and capabilities to help you reshape, refine, and extract valuable insights from your data.

## Features

- **groupObjectsByKey:** designed to efficiently group an array of objects based on a specified key and assign a custom group name to the resulting groups. It filters and organizes the objects, ensuring that each group contains objects with the same key. This function simplifies the process of aggregating and organizing data, making it a valuable tool for data manipulation and analysis tasks in JavaScript applications.

- **removeObjectsByKeyValue:** takes an array of objects and removes those where a specified key has a specific value. It returns a filtered array containing only the objects that do not match the given key-value pair. The function achieves this by using the `Array.filter()` method, ensuring that the resulting array contains objects that do not have the specified key-value combination.
